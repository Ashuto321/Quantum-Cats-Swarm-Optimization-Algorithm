Qunatum Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm(QCSO)
In this QCSOA we are going to use Quantum Mechanics to optimize the Algorithm called QCSOA.

How Problem Movies

1.Define the Problem
2.Initialize the cat Swarm
3.Update the cat position
4.Evaluate the objective function for each cat
5.Update the global best position
6.Repeat steps 3-5 until a terminate criterion is met

This problem combines cats position with Quantum Mechanics to make higher accuracy
